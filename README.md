# SecureSessionHandler

Extends PHPs [SessionHandler](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.sessionhandler.php) class.

Provides static functions for session management.

Throws exception on error.

## Properties settable in $config

These properties are described in [extras/includes](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice/tree/master/extras/includes#session_name).

 - session_name

 - domain

 - lifetime

 - path

 - secure

 - bypassHijackingTest

## Public Methods:

```php
try {
  SecureSessionHandler::start_session($config);
} catch (Exception $e) {
  echo $e->getMessage();
  exit;
}
```

This function will try to use ` ini_set() ` to apply the following settings:

- [session.use_only_cookies](https://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.use-only-cookies) = 1

- [session.use_strict_mode](https://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.use-strict-mode) = 1

- [session.cookie_secure](https://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.cookie-secure) = the configured value of ` $config['secure'] `

- [session.use_trans_sid](https://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.use-trans-sid) = 0

If these settings fail an exception will be thrown.

If a [valid session name](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.session-name.php) is not provided an exception will be thrown.

If a domain name is not provided ` $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] ` will be used.

If ` $config['bypassHijackingTest'] ` is ` false ` the users IP address and user agent will be stored in the session and compared to the values provided by the server upon each validation call which is done every time ` SecureSessionHandler::start_session() ` is called. It is not recommended that this value be set to ` true ` however, it may be necessary in situations where a users IP address is frequently changed due to network instability or service provider issues.

` $_SESSION['formKey'] ` is set to a value generated by ` mt_rand() `. Validation will compare this value to ` $_POST['formKey'] ` on every POST request then iterate the value. An exception with the message "Session Error" will be thrown if these values don't match.

```php
echo SecureSessionHandler::outputKey();
```

Returns the current value of ` $_SESSION['formKey'] `.

```php
SecureSessionHandler::destroySession();
```

- Clears session values.

- Preserves the value of ` $_SESSION['formKey'] `.

- Destroys the current session.

- Regenerates the session ID.

```php
try {
  $key = SecureSessionHandler::newKey($config);
} catch(Exception $e) {
  $key = $e->getMessage();
}
echo $key;
return false;
```

Sets and returns a new value for ` $_SESSION['formKey'] `.

If there is no active session an attempt will be made to create one.

            Select tickets with charge equal to 5 and billed to clients other than client 1.
            ```php
            $data['queryParams']['filter'] = [];

            $data['queryParams']['filter'][] = ['Resource'=>'Charge', 'Filter'=>'eq', 'Value'=>5];

            $data['queryParams']['filter'][] = ['Resource'=>'BillTo', 'Filter'=>'neq', 'Value'=>1];
            ```
          - complex "and" & "or" query:

            Indexed array of simple "and" queries. Ex:

            $filter1[] = ['Resource'=>'BillTo', 'Filter'=>'eq', 'Value'=>1];

            $filter2 = [ ['Resource'=>'BillTo', 'Filter'=>'eq', 'Value'=>2] ];

            $data['queryParams']['filter'] = [$filter1, $filter2];
            ```
          - available filters:

            * cs: contain string (string contains value)

            * lt: lower than (number is lower than value)
            * le: lower or equal (number is lower than or equal to value)
            * ge: greater or equal (number is higher than or equal to value)
            * gt: greater than (number is higher than value)
            * bt: between (number is between two comma separated values)
            * in: in (number is in comma separated list of values)
            * is: is null (field contains "NULL" value)
            * You can negate all filters by prepending a 'n' character, so that 'eq' becomes 'neq'.

       + order

         Indexed array of ordering parameters. With the "order" parameter you can sort. By default the sort is in ascending order, but by specifying "desc" this can be reversed. Ex:
         ```php
         $data['queryParams']['order'] = ['DispatchTimeStamp,desc'];
         ```
         or
         ```php
         $data['queryParams']['order'] = ['BillTo', 'DispatchTimeStamp,desc'];
         ```
       + page

          - string

          - The "page" parameter holds the requested page. The default page size is 20, but can be adjusted (e.g. to 50). Pages that are not ordered cannot be paginated. EX:

          ```php
          $data['queryParams']['page'] = '1';
          ```
          or
          ```php
          $data['queryParams']['page'] = '1,50';
          ```
## Public Methods

```php
$query->buildURI();
```
Processes the queryParams property into a query string then returns itself so that it can be chained with the call method.

```php
$query->call();
```
Uses the cURL library to execute the query string. Returns the result of the query or throws Exception on error. Ex:

```php
try {
  $query->buildURI()->call();
} catch (Exception $e) {
  return $e->getMessage();
}
```

# extras

This is an extendable drop-in implementation of this set of classes using jQuery v3.3.1.

[jQuery.ajaxRetry](https://github.com/dcherman/jQuery.ajaxRetry) is used to implement a simple backoff.

A templet for ajax calls with this backoff built in is also included. This will retry a failed call 20 times waiting ` n * 250 ` milliseconds between calls where n is the retry count. The function returns the jQuery ajax object.

```javascript
  ajax_template(callMethod, url, returnType, postData=false)
```

Usage:

```javascript
  let postData =  { "formKey": $("#formKey").val(), "ticket_index": $(".ticket_index").val() }
  let attempt = ajax_template("post", "../ajax/doSomething.php", "html", postData)
  .done((result)=>{
    // SecureSessionHandler iterates the value of the session formKey so it must be iterated here as well.
    $("#formKey").val(Number($("#formKey").val()) + 1);
    // do something with the returned html
  })
  .fail((jqXHR, status, error)=>{
    // display error
  });
```

[Signature Pad v2.3.2](https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad) is preconfigured with [extras/public_html/app_js/sigPad.js](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice/tree/master/extras/public_html/app_js/sigPad.js) to collect signatures in conjunction with the functions ` $ticket->displaySingleTicket() ` and ` $ticket->displayMultiTicket() `.

The function ` toast(msg, options) ` is exported to the global scope. It creates and deletes a toast-like div to show messages to the user.

Usage:

```javascript
  let options = {},
      msg = "Test Message";
  options.title = "sample div title"; // title attribute of toast div. default ""
  options.time = 3000; // milliseconds to show toast div. div will be removed 1 second after it is hidden. default 4000
  options.eleClass = "ticketOncallReceived"; // custom class for the toast div. The function will display only the newest of a custom class, removing previous messages. All default class divs will be displayed for the configured time. default "toast__msg"
  options.datatime = 1512574797926; // unix time stamp to parse for display with message. default new Date().getTime();
  toast(msg, options);
```

### Features

Uses ticket information from database to populate datalist elements to assist form completion.

Single page design navigated by either swipe or menu. Offers unique features based upon user type.

At the end of the transition between pages ` scroll(0,0) ` is called and a window event named 'pageChange' is triggered.

Setting the order of menu items as well as adding custom menu items (with or without matching pages), and javascript files is handled in the config file located at [extras/includes](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice/tree/master/extras/includes).
